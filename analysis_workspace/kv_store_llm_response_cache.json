The well casing shall extend above the ground about 60cm. The top end must have a sealed\ncap or wellhead box to prevent water ingress. For a steel casing, the exposed top section\nmust be painted or coated to prevent corrosion.\n4. Angle of inclination from vertical will not to exceed 2.5 degrees at any point in the\nborehole.\n5. Casing must be completely round, with no ellipticity; the inner surface of casing must be\nsmooth with no irregularities such as welds or couplings, which would reduce the inner\ndiameter.\n6. The casing must be well cemented into the ground, from the bottom up.\n7. Steel casing with water-tight joints will be installed for the entire length of the borehole.\n8. Inner diameter of the casing should be between 12.7 and 17.8 cm (5 and 7 inches) with a\nminimum casing wall thickness of 0.62 cm (0.244 inches).\n9. A water-tight cement or steel plug should be completely cemented to the bottom of the\nborehole.\n10. The outer wall of casing should be completely cemented to the rock along the entire length\nof the borehole; cementation must ensure high-quality contact between the casing and the\nrock walls.\n5\n\n[Page 25]\n11. The final cased borehole has to admit a test gauge, to be provided by the Contractor, of\nsimilar dimensions to the equipment to be installed at the borehole, approximately 81.2 cm\nin length and 9.5 cm in diameter.

Summary of the project\nThe 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097 at Babate, Senegal (hereinafter referred to\nas “the Station”) is part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Preparatory\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (hereinafter\nreferred to as “the Commission”). More information can be found under www.ctbto.org\nThe name, code and coordinates for the Station are Babate, BBTS, 14.66132° N, 16.53323° W.\nThe Station is at the site located approximately 75 km from the city of Mbour, Senegal. The\nstation is certified in 2007, to install the sensor inside the borehole, a 70m deep borehole was\ndrilled in 2004; obstruction, verticality and leaking tests have been performed but later it’s been\nfound that borehole had about 50m of water inside the casing. It was decided to drill another\nborehole which was drilled in 2006. After the drilling, a slight leaking was observed, but sensor\nwas installed inside the borehole. Over the years, water and mud filled up the borehole and\nresulted corrosion on the casing. In 2023 the damaged sensor was pulled up and water was\ncleaned, however some water leakage was observed after the cleaning as well. Summary of the\nreport from the contractor is given in Section 7 in these TOR.\nThe Commission considers rehabilitating the existing borehole (LOT 1) or drilling a new\nborehole (LOT 2) and seeking a company specialized in these types of works. The Contractor\ncan provide proposals on one or both lots.\nLOT 1: Rehabilitating the existing borehole include (Section 2);\n- Cleaning the borehole\n- Cleaning and sealing the casing\n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well\n- A pressure test after the cement dries to make sure no water entry to the Well\nLOT 2: Drilling a new borehole (section 3);\nThe new cased borehole will be used to house a seismic instrument, which is a highly-\nsensitive vibration-measuring device. The borehole needs to be nearly vertical and\npermanently sealed against water leakage from bottom to top. For this reason, the casing\nmust be completely coupled over its entire length to the surrounding rock by careful\ncementation. A range of the inner diameter of the cased borehole is given to allow the\nContractor to use the most cost-efficient drill bit available for drilling the borehole. This\nrange also allows a variety of installations of seismic equipment in order to fit the site.\nTechnical specifications of the borehole are given in section.1 3 in these TOR; however,\nsome important aspects of the borehole would be:\n- Corrosion-resistant stainless-steel casing\n- Steel casing is cemented into the borehole to stabilize the casing, provide good coupling to\nthe ground, and maintain the integrity of underground aquifers.\n- A cement/bentonite-based grouting between borehole and the casing to seal the borehole to\nprevent any fluid movement, reinforce the hole against pressure.\nThese Terms of Reference provide the technical description and requirements for the Work\nTasks that shall be performed by the Contractor.\n3\n\n[Page 23]\n2.

Summary of the project\\nThe 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097 at Babate, Senegal (hereinafter referred to\\nas “the Station”) is part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Preparatory\\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (hereinafter\\nreferred to as “the Commission”). More information can be found under www.ctbto.org\\nThe name, code and coordinates for the Station are Babate, BBTS, 14.66132° N, 16.53323° W.\\nThe Station is at the site located approximately 75 km from the city of Mbour, Senegal. The\\nstation is certified in 2007, to install the sensor inside the borehole, a 70m deep borehole was\\ndrilled in 2004; obstruction, verticality and leaking tests have been performed but later it’s been\\nfound that borehole had about 50m of water inside the casing. It was decided to drill another\\nborehole which was drilled in 2006. After the drilling, a slight leaking was observed, but sensor\\nwas installed inside the borehole. Over the years, water and mud filled up the borehole and\\nresulted corrosion on the casing. In 2023 the damaged sensor was pulled up and water was\\ncleaned, however some water leakage was observed after the cleaning as well. Summary of the\\nreport from the contractor is given in Section 7 in these TOR.\\nThe Commission considers rehabilitating the existing borehole (LOT 1) or drilling a new\\nborehole (LOT 2) and seeking a company specialized in these types of works. The Contractor\\ncan provide proposals on one or both lots.\\nLOT 1: Rehabilitating the existing borehole include (Section 2);\\n- Cleaning the borehole\\n- Cleaning and sealing the casing\\n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well\\n- A pressure test after the cement dries to make sure no water entry to the Well\\nLOT 2: Drilling a new borehole (section 3);\\nThe new cased borehole will be used to house a seismic instrument, which is a highly-\\nsensitive vibration-measuring device. The borehole needs to be nearly vertical and\\npermanently sealed against water leakage from bottom to top. For this reason, the casing\\nmust be completely coupled over its entire length to the surrounding rock by careful\\ncementation. A range of the inner diameter of the cased borehole is given to allow the\\nContractor to use the most cost-efficient drill bit available for drilling the borehole. This\\nrange also allows a variety of installations of seismic equipment in order to fit the site.\\nTechnical specifications of the borehole are given in section.1 3 in these TOR; however,\\nsome important aspects of the borehole would be:\\n- Corrosion-resistant stainless-steel casing\\n- Steel casing is cemented into the borehole to stabilize the casing, provide good coupling to\\nthe ground, and maintain the integrity of underground aquifers.\\n- A cement/bentonite-based grouting between borehole and the casing to seal the borehole to\\nprevent any fluid movement, reinforce the hole against pressure.\\nThese Terms of Reference provide the technical description and requirements for the Work\\nTasks that shall be performed by the Contractor.\\n3\\n\\n[Page 23]\\n2.

The borehole must be left dry after the leak test and sealed with a removable cap.\n3.2 Contractor Responsibilities during Borehole Drilling\na) The Contractor shall be prepared for any situation that might occur. The contractor must\nhave sufficient equipment and supplies on location, including surface conductor and surface\ncasing, to case off any surface alluvium that might be present during drilling. The\nContractor must have sufficient lost circulation material on location to meet any demands.\nThe Contractor must have sufficient cement on hand and a proper pump in order to cement\noff any loss of circulation zones. If the Drilling Contractor is in an area where cement\nservice companies are readily available, then a cement-service sub-contractor may be used.\nIn order for the borehole to be cemented from bottom to top satisfactorily as specified, each\nwater or lost circulation zone shall be plugged or cemented off or sealed with lost\ncirculation material before continuing drilling the borehole.\nb) The Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site. Care shall\nbe taken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue\ndamage to the property on which the work is being performed. After completion of the\nwork described in this specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual\nmaterial resulting from the drilling operation or equipment. The surface shall be free of\ndrilling mud, cuttings, scrap equipment, foliage, packing, and related items. The surface\nshall be smoothed to its original contours with all vehicle ruts covered.\nc) The Contractor will keep the Commission fully informed of the progress, or any problems\nencountered, during the drilling or cementation process. Severe problems encountered\nduring drilling may change the planned location of the borehole. Such a situation must be\ndiscussed immediately with the Commission. Deviations from target depths, or from the\nexact location, can be made as an emergency if appropriate geological justifications are\ndiscovered during drilling, and if the Commission is notified of the proposed changes and\naccepts the proposed changes.\nd) The finished borehole must comply with the tests indicated in these TOR. The\nContractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the finished borehole complies with the\nacceptance test and requirements of verticality, diameter size, water-tightness, and quality of\ncementation indicated in these TOR.\n3.3 Description of the Work to be performed.\n3.3.1 Preparation\nThe Contractor shall select an appropriate site for the drilling inside the station premises. The\nexact location to be approved by the Commission before drilling starts. The Contractor will\nprepare the site, including leveling, and the removal of debris, stones, objects, heavy growths of\nvegetation or other materials undesirable for the drilling. The Contractor shall transport all\ndrilling equipment to the site with their own resources.\n6\n\n[Page 26]\n3.3.2 Drilling\nThe borehole will be drilled using an appropriately sized drill bit for the final choice of casing\ndiameters, while allowing for sufficient annular space to securely grout the casing to the rock\nformation. It is recommended that the borehole be drilled between 21.6 cm (8.5 inches) and\n26.7 cm (10-5/8 inches). Drilling should be done by the most cost-efficient method, which is\nusually with a tri-cone rotary drill bit. Samples of drill cuttings (normal rock detritus created by\nthe rotary drilling and floated to the surface in drilling mud), should be collected at about 5-\nmeter intervals for each borehole for use in the description of the geological make-up within\neach borehole. This information will be required as part of the drilling report.\nThe vertical offset or drift for the deep borehole shall not exceed 2.5 degrees from true vertical\nmeasurement at any point from the top to the bottom of the cased hole. It is suggested that this\nbe achieved as follows: While drilling, pull-down pressure on the Kelly should be avoided. Drill\npressure should be provided solely by the weight of the drill collars. An appropriate device,\nsuch as a Baker Tool TOTCO Recorder shall be used during the drilling to ensure that the hole\nis not drifting from vertical.\nWhen total depth of the borehole is reached at the proper diameter, circulation shall be\nmaintained for approximately one (1) hour to assure that the hole is free of cuttings and cavings.\n3.3.3 Casing\nThe borehole shall be cased to its total depth using seamless steel casing, with standard threads\nand collars, leaving an inner diameter between 14.5 cm (5.69 inches), and 17.8 cm (7.0 inches).\nThe preferred casing material is corrosion-resistant stainless-steel or similar material provides\ncorrosion protection. The casing minimum wall thickness shall be 6.2 cm (¼ inch). The casing\nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams). The\ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but\nminimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The casing minimum wall thickness shall be 6.2 cm (¼ inch). The casing\nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams). The\ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but\nminimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type\n(diameter, wall thickness, and composition) of casing section for its total depth.\nBefore proceeding with drilling the contractor must notify the Commission in writing with\ndimensions of the chosen casing. Threaded casing joints using BTC (buttress-threaded\nconnections) are preferred. All threaded joints should be coated with joint compound and\ntightened using sufficient torque. A torque of 1000 foot-pounds is recommended. Any casing\nthat meets these specifications is acceptable.\nImmediately prior to cementing, a turbulent flow of clear water and a cleaning solution shall be\ncirculated down the casing and up the annulus to clean out any mud and debris that is present to\nsecure a good cement bond. The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet)\nabove the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.\n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting\nThe Contractor has the flexibility of selecting a preferred cementation method that will\ncompletely bond the casing string to the rock walls over its entire depth with no voids or\nshrinkage. For example, cementation can be accomplished through the casing using a cement\nshoe and plunger method, cementation can be done via external grout tubes in the annulus\nbetween the casing and host rock where the casing string is sealed by a welded plate at the\nbottom. However, the preferred cementation process is to pump cement grout through the\ninterior of the casing using a plunger and cement shoe and flush the full volume up the annular\nspace between the exterior casing wall and the rock to the surface. The cement shoe and collar\n7\n\n[Page 27]\nwill form the cement plug at the bottom of the casing. Typical cement grout composition uses\ncement, sand, bentonite (clay), water, and an expansive additive to prevent shrinkage upon\ndrying.\nThe borehole shall be cemented from bottom to top. The following procedure is recommended.\nCement slurry with sufficient volume to fill the annulus with at least 25% excess shall be\npumped into the casing. Then a latch down plug shall be inserted into the casing and washed\ndown with clear water. When the plug reaches the baffle, normally 1,000 pounds per square\ninch of pressure should force the latching nose of the plug into the baffle and lock it in place.\nOnce the plug is seated, all pressure must be released to check for zero back-flow, this will\nprove that the one-way valves are holding. When zero back-flow is obtained, the cement slurry\nshall be allowed to cure for 24 hours under no pressure before performing any activities that\ncould disturb the bond, such as blowing or bailing the borehole dry of water or proceeding with\nthe acceptance tests.\nAfter 24 hours, the casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.\nIf the cement level drops in the annular space between the pipe and the hole, additional cement\nslurry may be added around the casing directly from the surface. The level of the cement grout\nin the annular space between the casing and the rock wall must be monitored during the\nhardening process. If the level drops, additional cement grout must be added around the casing\nfrom the top using small feed pipes if necessary.\n3.3.5 Construction of borehole well-head and enclosure\nA concrete pad around the top of the borehole casing (“well-head”) with a thickness of 10 to\n20cm and approximately 1m x 1m in area (if square) or approximately 1mdiameter (if circular)\nis to be constructed. In addition, a housing or enclosure around the top of the well-head for\nprotection against the environment shall be built. This enclosure will provide shelter from\nwater, snow, theft, small animals, etc. A simple inverted “bin” with a rubber or synthetic gasket,\nbolted to the concrete pad, will suffice. The pad must include an L- or U-shaped conduit for the\nentry of the signal cable that will be protected under the well-head enclosure.\n3.3.6 Site remediation\nThe Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site. Care shall be\ntaken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue damage to\nthe property on which the work is being performed. After completion of the work described in\nthis specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual material resulting from the\ndrilling operation or equipment. The surface shall be free of drilling mud, cuttings, scrap\nequipment, foliage, packing, and related items. The surface shall be smoothed to its original\ncontours with all vehicle ruts covered.\n3.4 Acceptance tests.\nThe Contractor will perform a series of acceptance tests as described below.\n3.4.1 Verticality Test:\nA final verticality test must be performed in the interior of the casing after cementation.\nMeasurements should be made of the deviation from the vertical at 15 m depth intervals and at\nthe base of the borehole.\n8\n\n[Page 28]\n3.4.2 Leak Test:\nThe final cased and cemented borehole must be checked against leaks by completely filling the\ncasing with water and recording that the water level has not dropped after 24 hours.

The casing minimum wall thickness shall be 6.2 cm (¼ inch). The casing\\nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams). The\\ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but\\nminimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type\\n(diameter, wall thickness, and composition) of casing section for its total depth.\\nBefore proceeding with drilling the contractor must notify the Commission in writing with\\ndimensions of the chosen casing. Threaded casing joints using BTC (buttress-threaded\\nconnections) are preferred. All threaded joints should be coated with joint compound and\\ntightened using sufficient torque. A torque of 1000 foot-pounds is recommended. Any casing\\nthat meets these specifications is acceptable.\\nImmediately prior to cementing, a turbulent flow of clear water and a cleaning solution shall be\\ncirculated down the casing and up the annulus to clean out any mud and debris that is present to\\nsecure a good cement bond. The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet)\\nabove the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.\\n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting\\nThe Contractor has the flexibility of selecting a preferred cementation method that will\\ncompletely bond the casing string to the rock walls over its entire depth with no voids or\\nshrinkage. For example, cementation can be accomplished through the casing using a cement\\nshoe and plunger method, cementation can be done via external grout tubes in the annulus\\nbetween the casing and host rock where the casing string is sealed by a welded plate at the\\nbottom. However, the preferred cementation process is to pump cement grout through the\\ninterior of the casing using a plunger and cement shoe and flush the full volume up the annular\\nspace between the exterior casing wall and the rock to the surface. The cement shoe and collar\\n7\\n\\n[Page 27]\\nwill form the cement plug at the bottom of the casing. Typical cement grout composition uses\\ncement, sand, bentonite (clay), water, and an expansive additive to prevent shrinkage upon\\ndrying.\\nThe borehole shall be cemented from bottom to top. The following procedure is recommended.\\nCement slurry with sufficient volume to fill the annulus with at least 25% excess shall be\\npumped into the casing. Then a latch down plug shall be inserted into the casing and washed\\ndown with clear water. When the plug reaches the baffle, normally 1,000 pounds per square\\ninch of pressure should force the latching nose of the plug into the baffle and lock it in place.\\nOnce the plug is seated, all pressure must be released to check for zero back-flow, this will\\nprove that the one-way valves are holding. When zero back-flow is obtained, the cement slurry\\nshall be allowed to cure for 24 hours under no pressure before performing any activities that\\ncould disturb the bond, such as blowing or bailing the borehole dry of water or proceeding with\\nthe acceptance tests.\\nAfter 24 hours, the casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.\\nIf the cement level drops in the annular space between the pipe and the hole, additional cement\\nslurry may be added around the casing directly from the surface. The level of the cement grout\\nin the annular space between the casing and the rock wall must be monitored during the\\nhardening process. If the level drops, additional cement grout must be added around the casing\\nfrom the top using small feed pipes if necessary.\\n3.3.5 Construction of borehole well-head and enclosure\\nA concrete pad around the top of the borehole casing (“well-head”) with a thickness of 10 to\\n20cm and approximately 1m x 1m in area (if square) or approximately 1mdiameter (if circular)\\nis to be constructed. In addition, a housing or enclosure around the top of the well-head for\\nprotection against the environment shall be built. This enclosure will provide shelter from\\nwater, snow, theft, small animals, etc. A simple inverted “bin” with a rubber or synthetic gasket,\\nbolted to the concrete pad, will suffice. The pad must include an L- or U-shaped conduit for the\\nentry of the signal cable that will be protected under the well-head enclosure.\\n3.3.6 Site remediation\\nThe Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site. Care shall be\\ntaken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue damage to\\nthe property on which the work is being performed. After completion of the work described in\\nthis specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual material resulting from the\\ndrilling operation or equipment. The surface shall be free of drilling mud, cuttings, scrap\\nequipment, foliage, packing, and related items. The surface shall be smoothed to its original\\ncontours with all vehicle ruts covered.\\n3.4 Acceptance tests.\\nThe Contractor will perform a series of acceptance tests as described below.\\n3.4.1 Verticality Test:\\nA final verticality test must be performed in the interior of the casing after cementation.\\nMeasurements should be made of the deviation from the vertical at 15 m depth intervals and at\\nthe base of the borehole.\\n8\\n\\n[Page 28]\\n3.4.2 Leak Test:\\nThe final cased and cemented borehole must be checked against leaks by completely filling the\\ncasing with water and recording that the water level has not dropped after 24 hours.

The Contractor shall transport all\\ndrilling equipment to the site with their own resources.\\n6\\n\\n[Page 26]\\n3.3.2 Drilling\\nThe borehole will be drilled using an appropriately sized drill bit for the final choice of casing\\ndiameters, while allowing for sufficient annular space to securely grout the casing to the rock\\nformation. It is recommended that the borehole be drilled between 21.6 cm (8.5 inches) and\\n26.7 cm (10-5/8 inches). Drilling should be done by the most cost-efficient method, which is\\nusually with a tri-cone rotary drill bit. Samples of drill cuttings (normal rock detritus created by\\nthe rotary drilling and floated to the surface in drilling mud), should be collected at about 5-\\nmeter intervals for each borehole for use in the description of the geological make-up within\\neach borehole. This information will be required as part of the drilling report.\\nThe vertical offset or drift for the deep borehole shall not exceed 2.5 degrees from true vertical\\nmeasurement at any point from the top to the bottom of the cased hole. It is suggested that this\\nbe achieved as follows: While drilling, pull-down pressure on the Kelly should be avoided. Drill\\npressure should be provided solely by the weight of the drill collars. An appropriate device,\\nsuch as a Baker Tool TOTCO Recorder shall be used during the drilling to ensure that the hole\\nis not drifting from vertical.\\nWhen total depth of the borehole is reached at the proper diameter, circulation shall be\\nmaintained for approximately one (1) hour to assure that the hole is free of cuttings and cavings.\\n3.3.3 Casing\\nThe borehole shall be cased to its total depth using seamless steel casing, with standard threads\\nand collars, leaving an inner diameter between 14.5 cm (5.69 inches), and 17.8 cm (7.0 inches).\\nThe preferred casing material is corrosion-resistant stainless-steel or similar material provides\\ncorrosion protection. The casing minimum wall thickness shall be 6.2 cm (¼ inch). The casing\\nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams). The\\ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but\\nminimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Commission\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission is responsible for overseeing the drilling process, ensuring compliance with specifications and monitoring progress.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor is tasked with carrying out the drilling and cementation processes, ensuring all specified requirements are met.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"borehole\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The borehole is the site of drilling activity that must meet various technical specifications related to quality and safety.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"cementation\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Cementation is a crucial process in the drilling operation, ensuring a watertight seal between the casing and the rock walls.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"Commission\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor must keep the Commission informed of the drilling progress and any encountered issues during the process.\\\"<|>\\\"oversight, communication\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"borehole\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor is directly responsible for the drilling and maintenance of the borehole, adhering to specifications and safety standards.\\\"<|>\\\"responsibility, execution\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Commission\\\"<|>\\\"borehole\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission oversees the specifications and compliance for the borehole drilling process.\\\"<|>\\\"oversight, compliance\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"borehole\\\"<|>\\\"cementation\\\"<|>\\\"Cementation must be properly carried out to ensure the borehole is watertight and meets quality specifications.\\\"<|>\\\"process, quality assurance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"drilling, oversight, cementation, compliance\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
