The \nexact location to be approved by the Commission before drilling starts. The Contractor will prepare the site, including leveling, and the removal of debris, stones, objects, heavy growths of vegetation or other materials undesirable for the drilling. The Contractor shall transport all drilling equipment to the site with their own resources.  7 \n 3.3.2 Drilling  \nThe borehole will be drilled using an appropriately sized drill bit for the final choice of casing \ndiameters, while allowing for sufficient annular space to securely grout the casing to the rock formation.  It is recommended that the borehole be drilled between 21.6 cm (8.5 inches) and 26.7 cm (10 -\n5/8 inches).  Drilling should be done by the most cost -efficient method, which is \nusually with a tri- cone rotary drill bit.  Samples of drill cuttings (normal rock detritus created by \nthe rotary drilling and floated to the surface in drilling mud), should be collected at about 5 -\nmeter intervals for each borehole for use in the description of the geological make -up within \neach borehole. This information will be required as part of the drilling report.  \nThe vertical offset or drift for the deep borehole shall not exceed 2.5 degrees from true vertical measurement at any point from the top to the bottom of the cased hole.  It is suggested that this be achieved as follows: While drilling, pull -down pressure on the Kelly should be avoided. Drill \npressure should be provided solely by the weight of the drill collars.  An appropriate device, such as a Baker Tool TOTCO Recorder shall be used during the drilling to ensure that the hole is not drifting from vertical.  \nWhen total depth of the borehole is reached at the proper diameter, circulation shall be maintained for approximately one (1) hour to assure that the hole is free of cuttings and cavings.  \n3.3.3 Casing  \nThe borehole shall be cased to its total depth using seamless steel casing, with standard threads and collars, leaving an inner diameter between 14.5 cm (5.69 inches), and 17.8 cm (7.0 inches).  The preferred casing material is corrosion- resistant stainless -steel or similar material provides \ncorrosion protection. The casing minimum wall thickness shall be  6.2 cm ( ¼ inch ). The casing \nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams) .   The \ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but minimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type \n(diameter, wall thickness, and composition) of casing section for its total depth.  \nBefore proceeding with drilling the contractor must notify the Commission in writing with dimensions of the chosen casing. Threaded casing joints using BTC (buttress -threaded \nconnections) are preferred. All threaded joints should be coated with joint compound and \ntightened using sufficient torque.  A torque of 1000 foot -pounds is recommended.  Any casing \nthat meets these specifications is acceptable.  \nImmediately prior to cementing, a turbulent flow of clear water and a cleaning solution shall be circulated down the casing and up the annulus to clean out any mud and debris that is present to secure a good cement bond. The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet) above the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.  \n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting  \nThe Contractor has the flexibility\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Summary of the project \nThe 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097 at Babate, Senegal (hereinafter referred to \nas “the Station”) is part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Preparatory \nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear -Test-Ban Treaty Organization (hereinafter \nreferred to as “the Commission”). More information can be found under www.ctbto.org  \nThe name, code and coordinates for the Station are  Babate, BBTS , 14.66132 ° N, 16.53323 ° W. \nThe Station is at the site located approximately 75 km from the city of Mbour, Senegal.  The \nstation is certified in 2007, to install the sensor inside the borehole, a  70m deep borehole was \ndrilled in 2004; obstruction, verticality and leaking tests have been performed but later it’s been \nfound that borehole had about 50m of water inside the casing. It was decided to drill another \nborehole which was drilled in 2006. After the drilling, a slight leaking was observed, but sensor \nwas installed inside the borehole. Over the years, water and mud filled up the borehole and \nresulted corrosion on the casing. In 2023 the damaged sensor was pulled up and water was \ncleaned, however some water leakage was observed after the cleaning  as well . Summary of the \nreport from the contractor is given in Section 7 in these TOR.  \nThe Commission considers rehabilitating the existing borehole (LOT 1) or drilling a new \nborehole (LOT 2)  and seeking a company specialized in these types of works . The Contractor \ncan provide proposals on one or both lots.  \nLOT 1:  Rehabilitating the existing borehole  include  (Section 2) ; \n- Cleaning the borehole  \n- Cleaning and s ealing the casing  \n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well  \n- A pressure test after the cement dries to make sure no water entry to the Well  \n \nLOT 2:  Drilling a new borehole (section 3);  \nThe new cased borehole  will be used to house a seismic instrument, which is a highly -\nsensitive vibration -measuring device. The borehole needs to be nearly vertical and \npermanently sealed against water leakage from bottom to top. For this reason, the casing must be completely coupled over its entire length to the surrounding rock by careful \ncementation. A range of the inner diameter of the cased borehole is given to allow the \nContractor to use the most cost -efficient drill bit available for drilling the borehole. This \nrange also allows a variety of installations of seismic equipment in order to fit the site.  \nTechnical specifications of the borehole are given in section .1 3 in these TOR;  however,  \nsome important aspects of the borehole would be:  \n- Corrosion -resistant stainless- steel casing  \n- Steel casing is cemented into the borehole to stabilize the casing, provide good coupling to \nthe ground, and maintain the integrity of underground aquifers. \n- A cement/bentonite -based grouting between borehole and the casing to seal the borehole to \nprevent any fluid movement, reinforce the hole against pressure.  \n \nThese Terms of Reference provide the technical description and requirements for the Work Tasks that shall be performed by the Contractor.   \n  4 \n  \n \n2. Rehabilitating of the Existing Borehole  (LOT 1) \n Steps to rehabilitating the existing borehole include; \n- Cleaning the borehole  by pumping water and mud if exists \n This step is important for following steps.  \n- Inspect the borehole and casing  with camera  \n Inspecting the borehole with a camera is important to understand the status of the borehole \nand casing  before taking any actions . \n- Cleaning and sealing the casing  \n The casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.  \n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well  \n In order to stop water entry from the bottom of the Well, shall be cemented with high -early \nstrength cement (Portland type III).  \n- Borehole leak test : \nAll tools and equipment required for successful completion of the test, including but not \nlimited to, air compressors, valves, air pressure gauges and fittings, are to be provided by \nthe contractor. \n1. Wait 24 hours to allow cement and sealant to cure completely. \n2. Fill the borehole to the top with water.  \n3.  Seal the top of the borehole and pressurize the top air pocket to a minimum of\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet) above the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.  \n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting  \nThe Contractor has the flexibility of selecting a preferred cementation method that will completely bond the casing string to the rock walls over its entire depth with no voids or shrinkage. For example, cementation can be accomplished through the casing using a cement shoe and plunger method, cementation can be done via external grout tubes in the annulus between the casing and host rock where the casing string is sealed by a welded plate at the \nbottom. However, the preferred cementation process is to pump  cement grout through the \ninterior of the casing using a plunger and cement shoe and flush the full volume up the annular \nspace between the exterior casing wall and the rock to the surface. The cement shoe and collar 8 \n will form the cement plug at the bottom of the casing. Typical cement grout composition uses \ncement, sand, bentonite (clay), water, and an expansive additive to prevent shrinkage upon drying.  \nThe borehole shall be cemented from bottom to top. The following procedure is recommended.  Cement slurry with sufficient volume to fill the annulus with at least 25% excess shall be \npumped into the casing. Then a latch down plug shall be inserted into the casing and washed \ndown with clear water.  When the plug reaches the baffle, normally 1,000 pounds per square \ninch of pressure should force the latching nose of the plug into the baffle and lock it in place.  Once the plug is seated, all pressure must be released to check for zero back -flow, this will \nprove that the one -way valves are holding. When zero back- flow is obtained, the cement slurry \nshall be allowed to cure for 24 hours under no pressure before performing any activities that could disturb the bond, such as blowing or bailing the borehole dry of water or proceeding with the acceptance tests.   \nAfter 24 hours, the casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.  If the cement level drops in the annular space between the pipe and the hole, additional cement \nslurry may be added around the casing directly from the surface.  The level of the cement grout \nin the annular space between the casing and the rock wall must be monitored during the hardening process.  If the level drops, additional cement grout must be added around the casing from the top using small feed pipes if necessary.  \n3.3.5 Construction of borehole well -head and enclosure  \nA concrete pad around the top of the borehole casing (“well -head”) with a thickness of 10 to \n20cm and approximately 1m x 1m in area (if square) or approximately 1mdiameter (if circular) is to be constructed. In addition, a housing or enclosure around the top of the well -head for \nprotection against the environment shall be built. This enclosure will provide shelter from water, snow, theft, small animals, etc. A simple inverted “bin” with a rubber or synthetic gasket, bolted to the concrete pad, will suffice.  The pad must include an L - or U-shaped conduit for the \nentry of the signal cable that will be protected under the well- head enclosure.  \n3.3.6 Site remediation  \nThe Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site. Care shall be  \ntaken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue damage to the property on which the work is being performed.  After completion of the work described in this specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual material resulting from the drilling operation or equipment.  The surface shall be free of drilling mud, cuttings, scrap equipment, foliage, packing, and related items.  The surface shall be smoothed to its original contours with all vehicle ruts covered. \n3.4 Acceptance tests.  \nThe Contractor will perform a series of acceptance tests as described below.  \n \n3.4.1 Verticality Test:  \nA final verticality test must be performed in the interior of the casing after cementation. \nMeasurements should be made of the deviation from the vertical at 15 m depth intervals and at \nthe base of the borehole.  9 \n 3.4.2 Leak Test:  \nThe final cased and cemented borehole must be checked against leaks by completely filling the \ncasing with water and recording that the water level has not dropped after 24 hours. The \nborehole must then be emptied of water and left completely dry. \n3.4.3 Obstruction Test:  \nA test cylinder of 812 mm length and 95 mm diameter, to be provided by the drilling contractor, \nmust pass without obstruction to the bottom of the final borehole and then return to the surface. \nThis should be the final test performed.  \n3.4.4 Continued Monitoring:  \nThe borehole should be monitored on a weekly basis for at least one month to ensure that it \nremains watertight.  \n3.5 Drilling Report  \nWithin two months after the completion of the drilling, the Contractor will submit the Drilling Report, providing a full account of the drilling activities, any problems encountered during drilling and the specifications of the final cased borehole. The Contractor shall provide to the \nCommission 2 (two) copies of the Report in English. The report should include the\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The \\nContractor must have sufficient lost circulation material on location to meet any demands.  \\nThe Contractor must have sufficient cement on hand and a proper pump in order to cement \\noff any loss of circulation zones. If the Drilling Contractor is in an area where cement \\nservice companies are readily available, then a cement -service sub -contractor may be used.  \\nIn order for the borehole to be cemented from bottom to top satisfactorily as specified, each water or lost circulation zone shall be plugged or cemented off or  sealed with lost \\ncirculation material before continuing drilling the borehole.  \\nb) The Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site.  Care shall \\nbe taken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue damage to the property on which the work is being performed.  After completion of the work described in this specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual \\nmaterial resulting from the drilling operation or equipment.  The surface shall be free of \\ndrilling mud, cuttings, scrap equipment, foliage, packing, and related items.  The surface \\nshall be smoothed to its original contours with all vehicle ruts covered.   \\nc) The Contractor will keep the Commission fully informed of the progress, or any problems encountered, during the drilling or cementation process.   Severe problems encountered \\nduring drilling may change the planned location of the borehole.  Such a situation must be \\ndiscussed immediately with the Commission. Deviations from target depths, or from the \\nexact location, can be made as an emergency if appropriate geological justifications are discovered during drilling, and if the Commission is notified of the proposed changes and accepts the proposed changes.  \\nd) The finished borehole must comply with the tests indicated in these TOR. The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the finished borehole complies with the \\nacceptance test and requirements of verticality, diameter size, water -tightness, and quality of \\ncementation indicated in these TOR.  \\n3.3 Description of the Work to be performed.  \\n3.3.1 Preparation  \\nThe Contractor shall select an appropriate site for the drilling inside the station premises. The \\nexact location to be approved by the Commission before drilling starts. The Contractor will prepare the site, including leveling, and the removal of debris, stones, objects, heavy growths of vegetation or other materials undesirable for the drilling. The Contractor shall transport all drilling equipment to the site with their own resources.  7 \\n 3.3.2 Drilling  \\nThe borehole will be drilled using an appropriately sized drill bit for the final choice of casing \\ndiameters, while allowing for sufficient annular space to securely grout the casing to the rock formation.  It is recommended that the borehole be drilled between 21.6 cm (8.5 inches) and 26.7 cm (10 -\\n5/8 inches).  Drilling should be done by the most cost -efficient method, which is \\nusually with a tri- cone rotary drill bit.  Samples of drill cuttings (normal rock detritus created by \\nthe rotary drilling and floated to the surface in drilling mud), should be collected at about 5 -\\nmeter intervals for each borehole for use in the description of the geological make -up within \\neach borehole. This information will be required as part of the drilling report.  \\nThe vertical offset or drift for the deep borehole shall not exceed 2.5 degrees from true vertical measurement at any point from the top to the bottom of the cased hole.  It is suggested that this be achieved as follows: While drilling, pull -down pressure on the Kelly should be avoided. Drill \\npressure should be provided solely by the weight of the drill collars.  An appropriate device, such as a Baker Tool TOTCO Recorder shall be used during the drilling to ensure that the hole is not drifting from vertical.  \\nWhen total depth of the borehole is reached at the proper diameter, circulation shall be maintained for approximately one (1) hour to assure that the hole is free of cuttings and cavings.  \\n3.3.3 Casing  \\nThe borehole shall be cased to its total depth using seamless steel casing, with standard threads and collars, leaving an inner diameter between 14.5 cm (5.69 inches), and 17.8 cm (7.0 inches).  The preferred casing material is corrosion- resistant stainless -steel or similar material provides \\ncorrosion protection. The casing minimum wall thickness shall be  6.2 cm ( ¼ inch ). The casing \\nmust be round, straight, free of irregularities and seamless (cast, with no rolled seams) .   The \\ntotal length of the borehole casing shall be made up of sections of any standard length, but minimum length of sections should be 3 m. Casing string must be made of the same type \\n(diameter, wall thickness, and composition) of casing section for its total depth.  \\nBefore proceeding with drilling the contractor must notify the Commission in writing with dimensions of the chosen casing. Threaded casing joints using BTC (buttress -threaded \\nconnections) are preferred. All threaded joints should be coated with joint compound and \\ntightened using sufficient torque.  A torque of 1000 foot -pounds is recommended.  Any casing \\nthat meets these specifications is acceptable.  \\nImmediately prior to cementing, a turbulent flow of clear water and a cleaning solution shall be circulated down the casing and up the annulus to clean out any mud and debris that is present to secure a good cement bond. The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet) above the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.  \\n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting  \\nThe Contractor has the flexibility\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor is responsible for executing the drilling and cementation process, ensuring compliance with specifications such as borehole verticality, diameter size, and water tightness.

Summary of the project \\nThe 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097 at Babate, Senegal (hereinafter referred to \\nas “the Station”) is part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Preparatory \\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear -Test-Ban Treaty Organization (hereinafter \\nreferred to as “the Commission”). More information can be found under www.ctbto.org  \\nThe name, code and coordinates for the Station are  Babate, BBTS , 14.66132 ° N, 16.53323 ° W. \\nThe Station is at the site located approximately 75 km from the city of Mbour, Senegal.  The \\nstation is certified in 2007, to install the sensor inside the borehole, a  70m deep borehole was \\ndrilled in 2004; obstruction, verticality and leaking tests have been performed but later it’s been \\nfound that borehole had about 50m of water inside the casing. It was decided to drill another \\nborehole which was drilled in 2006. After the drilling, a slight leaking was observed, but sensor \\nwas installed inside the borehole. Over the years, water and mud filled up the borehole and \\nresulted corrosion on the casing. In 2023 the damaged sensor was pulled up and water was \\ncleaned, however some water leakage was observed after the cleaning  as well . Summary of the \\nreport from the contractor is given in Section 7 in these TOR.  \\nThe Commission considers rehabilitating the existing borehole (LOT 1) or drilling a new \\nborehole (LOT 2)  and seeking a company specialized in these types of works . The Contractor \\ncan provide proposals on one or both lots.  \\nLOT 1:  Rehabilitating the existing borehole  include  (Section 2) ; \\n- Cleaning the borehole  \\n- Cleaning and s ealing the casing  \\n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well  \\n- A pressure test after the cement dries to make sure no water entry to the Well  \\n \\nLOT 2:  Drilling a new borehole (section 3);  \\nThe new cased borehole  will be used to house a seismic instrument, which is a highly -\\nsensitive vibration -measuring device. The borehole needs to be nearly vertical and \\npermanently sealed against water leakage from bottom to top. For this reason, the casing must be completely coupled over its entire length to the surrounding rock by careful \\ncementation. A range of the inner diameter of the cased borehole is given to allow the \\nContractor to use the most cost -efficient drill bit available for drilling the borehole. This \\nrange also allows a variety of installations of seismic equipment in order to fit the site.  \\nTechnical specifications of the borehole are given in section .1 3 in these TOR;  however,  \\nsome important aspects of the borehole would be:  \\n- Corrosion -resistant stainless- steel casing  \\n- Steel casing is cemented into the borehole to stabilize the casing, provide good coupling to \\nthe ground, and maintain the integrity of underground aquifers. \\n- A cement/bentonite -based grouting between borehole and the casing to seal the borehole to \\nprevent any fluid movement, reinforce the hole against pressure.  \\n \\nThese Terms of Reference provide the technical description and requirements for the Work Tasks that shall be performed by the Contractor.   \\n  4 \\n  \\n \\n2. Rehabilitating of the Existing Borehole  (LOT 1) \\n Steps to rehabilitating the existing borehole include; \\n- Cleaning the borehole  by pumping water and mud if exists \\n This step is important for following steps.  \\n- Inspect the borehole and casing  with camera  \\n Inspecting the borehole with a camera is important to understand the status of the borehole \\nand casing  before taking any actions . \\n- Cleaning and sealing the casing  \\n The casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.  \\n- Cementing of the bottom of the Well  \\n In order to stop water entry from the bottom of the Well, shall be cemented with high -early \\nstrength cement (Portland type III).  \\n- Borehole leak test : \\nAll tools and equipment required for successful completion of the test, including but not \\nlimited to, air compressors, valves, air pressure gauges and fittings, are to be provided by \\nthe contractor. \\n1. Wait 24 hours to allow cement and sealant to cure completely. \\n2. Fill the borehole to the top with water.  \\n3.  Seal the top of the borehole and pressurize the top air pocket to a minimum of\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The 3 Component Auxiliary Seismic Station AS097, located at Babate, Senegal, is part of the International Monitoring System for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.

ANNEX: Technical Report for the cleaning of the existing Borehole \n \nAs part of the BBTS station restoration project, the HYDROCONSULTANCE company cleaned the well in order \nto make it dry for the proper functioning of the seismic probe.  \n \n7.1 Resources used during the cleaning.  \nA 7.5KW power submersible pump with an electrical box.  \nA 25KVA generator.  \nA HDPE drainage tube with a diameter of 50mm and a length of 80m with accessories.  \nAn electrical cable with a diameter of 4X6mm and a length of 100m. \nA rope with a diameter of 15mm.  \nA double cabin pickup.  \n \n7.2 Works performed.  \nThe drilling cleaning work took place from 11/17/2023 to 11/18/2023.  \n11/17/2023:  \n- Installation of equipment on site  \n- Connection of the pump with the columns, the group generator and electric cable  \n- Lowering the pump to a depth of 55 m  \n- Progress of cleaning the well by pumping. \n11/18/2023  \n- Installation of the pump to the bottom approximately 60m  \n- Continued pumping until reaching the bottom of the borehole. \n- Demobilization of equipment  \n7.3 Results  \n-  Before pumping the water level in the well (static level) was 14.30m, after 05 minutes of \npumping the level dropped to 49.50m compared to the ground for the first day  \n-  On the second day (11/18/2023) the water level rose slightly by a few centimeters to 49.30m  \nWhen the pump descended to the bottom of the well and after pumping for 2 minutes, the level \ndropped to 59.60m. The color of the water was blackish, of poor quality which can be explained by very slow recharge and a slight deterioration of the walls of the borehole.  \n \n7.4 Conclusions and recommendations  \nDue to the low rise in the water level, the borehole is still functional and can house the seismic probe. We recommend cementing the bottom of the well to avoid water recharge in the borehole.  \n 12 \n 7.5 Pictures taken before cleaning and\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The casing strings shall be supported approximately 5 m (15 feet) above the bottom of the hole during cementing of the casing.  \\n3.3.4 Cementation and grouting  \\nThe Contractor has the flexibility of selecting a preferred cementation method that will completely bond the casing string to the rock walls over its entire depth with no voids or shrinkage. For example, cementation can be accomplished through the casing using a cement shoe and plunger method, cementation can be done via external grout tubes in the annulus between the casing and host rock where the casing string is sealed by a welded plate at the \\nbottom. However, the preferred cementation process is to pump  cement grout through the \\ninterior of the casing using a plunger and cement shoe and flush the full volume up the annular \\nspace between the exterior casing wall and the rock to the surface. The cement shoe and collar 8 \\n will form the cement plug at the bottom of the casing. Typical cement grout composition uses \\ncement, sand, bentonite (clay), water, and an expansive additive to prevent shrinkage upon drying.  \\nThe borehole shall be cemented from bottom to top. The following procedure is recommended.  Cement slurry with sufficient volume to fill the annulus with at least 25% excess shall be \\npumped into the casing. Then a latch down plug shall be inserted into the casing and washed \\ndown with clear water.  When the plug reaches the baffle, normally 1,000 pounds per square \\ninch of pressure should force the latching nose of the plug into the baffle and lock it in place.  Once the plug is seated, all pressure must be released to check for zero back -flow, this will \\nprove that the one -way valves are holding. When zero back- flow is obtained, the cement slurry \\nshall be allowed to cure for 24 hours under no pressure before performing any activities that could disturb the bond, such as blowing or bailing the borehole dry of water or proceeding with the acceptance tests.   \\nAfter 24 hours, the casing shall be scraped, brushed, and emptied of all fluids and loose solids.  If the cement level drops in the annular space between the pipe and the hole, additional cement \\nslurry may be added around the casing directly from the surface.  The level of the cement grout \\nin the annular space between the casing and the rock wall must be monitored during the hardening process.  If the level drops, additional cement grout must be added around the casing from the top using small feed pipes if necessary.  \\n3.3.5 Construction of borehole well -head and enclosure  \\nA concrete pad around the top of the borehole casing (“well -head”) with a thickness of 10 to \\n20cm and approximately 1m x 1m in area (if square) or approximately 1mdiameter (if circular) is to be constructed. In addition, a housing or enclosure around the top of the well -head for \\nprotection against the environment shall be built. This enclosure will provide shelter from water, snow, theft, small animals, etc. A simple inverted “bin” with a rubber or synthetic gasket, bolted to the concrete pad, will suffice.  The pad must include an L - or U-shaped conduit for the \\nentry of the signal cable that will be protected under the well- head enclosure.  \\n3.3.6 Site remediation  \\nThe Contractor will take care of property and removal of debris from the site. Care shall be  \\ntaken at all times during the work described in these specifications to prevent undue damage to the property on which the work is being performed.  After completion of the work described in this specification, the area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all residual material resulting from the drilling operation or equipment.  The surface shall be free of drilling mud, cuttings, scrap equipment, foliage, packing, and related items.  The surface shall be smoothed to its original contours with all vehicle ruts covered. \\n3.4 Acceptance tests.  \\nThe Contractor will perform a series of acceptance tests as described below.  \\n \\n3.4.1 Verticality Test:  \\nA final verticality test must be performed in the interior of the casing after cementation. \\nMeasurements should be made of the deviation from the vertical at 15 m depth intervals and at \\nthe base of the borehole.  9 \\n 3.4.2 Leak Test:  \\nThe final cased and cemented borehole must be checked against leaks by completely filling the \\ncasing with water and recording that the water level has not dropped after 24 hours. The \\nborehole must then be emptied of water and left completely dry. \\n3.4.3 Obstruction Test:  \\nA test cylinder of 812 mm length and 95 mm diameter, to be provided by the drilling contractor, \\nmust pass without obstruction to the bottom of the final borehole and then return to the surface. \\nThis should be the final test performed.  \\n3.4.4 Continued Monitoring:  \\nThe borehole should be monitored on a weekly basis for at least one month to ensure that it \\nremains watertight.  \\n3.5 Drilling Report  \\nWithin two months after the completion of the drilling, the Contractor will submit the Drilling Report, providing a full account of the drilling activities, any problems encountered during drilling and the specifications of the final cased borehole. The Contractor shall provide to the \\nCommission 2 (two) copies of the Report in English.

ANNEX: Technical Report for the cleaning of the existing Borehole \\n \\nAs part of the BBTS station restoration project, the HYDROCONSULTANCE company cleaned the well in order \\nto make it dry for the proper functioning of the seismic probe.  \\n \\n7.1 Resources used during the cleaning.  \\nA 7.5KW power submersible pump with an electrical box.  \\nA 25KVA generator.  \\nA HDPE drainage tube with a diameter of 50mm and a length of 80m with accessories.  \\nAn electrical cable with a diameter of 4X6mm and a length of 100m. \\nA rope with a diameter of 15mm.  \\nA double cabin pickup.  \\n \\n7.2 Works performed.  \\nThe drilling cleaning work took place from 11/17/2023 to 11/18/2023.  \\n11/17/2023:  \\n- Installation of equipment on site  \\n- Connection of the pump with the columns, the group generator and electric cable  \\n- Lowering the pump to a depth of 55 m  \\n- Progress of cleaning the well by pumping. \\n11/18/2023  \\n- Installation of the pump to the bottom approximately 60m  \\n- Continued pumping until reaching the bottom of the borehole. \\n- Demobilization of equipment  \\n7.3 Results  \\n-  Before pumping the water level in the well (static level) was 14.30m, after 05 minutes of \\npumping the level dropped to 49.50m compared to the ground for the first day  \\n-  On the second day (11/18/2023) the water level rose slightly by a few centimeters to 49.30m  \\nWhen the pump descended to the bottom of the well and after pumping for 2 minutes, the level \\ndropped to 59.60m. The color of the water was blackish, of poor quality which can be explained by very slow recharge and a slight deterioration of the walls of the borehole.  \\n \\n7.4 Conclusions and recommendations  \\nDue to the low rise in the water level, the borehole is still functional and can house the seismic probe. We recommend cementing the bottom of the well to avoid water recharge in the borehole.  \\n 12 \\n 7.5 Pictures taken before cleaning and\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor is responsible for executing the drilling operations, preparing reports, ensuring compliance with regulations, and maintaining safety standards.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission oversees the drilling operations, conducts inspections, and ensures compliance with the contract requirements.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Senegal\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Senegal is the country where the work is carried out, and it sets the national regulations and standards to be met by the Contractor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Drilling Report\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Drilling Report is a detailed document that the Contractor must submit within two months, covering all aspects of the drilling activities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BBTS Station Restoration Project\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The BBTS Station Restoration Project involves cleaning and preparing a borehole for the proper functioning of a seismic probe.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"HYDROCONSULTANCE company\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"HYDROCONSULTANCE company is involved in cleaning the borehole as part of the BBTS station restoration project.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Seismic Probe\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A device intended to be housed in the borehole, crucial for its function once the borehole is made watertight and cleaned.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor must work under the oversight of the Commission, adhering to contract specifications and implementing remedial actions if needed.\\\"<|>\\\"oversight, compliance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor\\\"<|>\\\"Senegal\\\"<|>\\\"The Contractor must conduct work in compliance with Senegal's national regulations related to health, safety, and environmental protection.\\\"<|>\\\"regulatory compliance, national standards\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"HYDROCONSULTANCE company\\\"<|>\\\"BBTS Station Restoration Project\\\"<|>\\\"HYDROCONSULTANCE company carries out cleaning of the borehole as part of the broader BBTS Station Restoration Project.\\\"<|>\\\"project execution, task assignment\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"The Drilling Report\\\"<|>\\\"The Commission\\\"<|>\\\"The Drilling Report is submitted to the Commission for review, forming a part of the documentation for compliance and completion verification.\\\"<|>\\\"documentation, compliance check\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"BBTS Station Restoration Project\\\"<|>\\\"Seismic Probe\\\"<|>\\\"The purpose of the BBTS Station Restoration Project is to prepare the borehole for housing the seismic probe, ensuring its proper functioning.\\\"<|>\\\"equipment preparation, project goal\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"drilling operations, regulatory compliance, safety standards, borehole cleaning, project execution\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
